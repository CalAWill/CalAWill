- 👋 Hi, I’m @CalAWill
- 👀 I’m interested in learning some bits and bobs about different projects. I like to work in java and python mostly, so I'm pretty basic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science at Edge Hill Uni, but I'm trying to do some extra coding projects, regardless of how rubbish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I'm up for giving anything a go that I can help on.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email - callumwilson2209@outlook.com
